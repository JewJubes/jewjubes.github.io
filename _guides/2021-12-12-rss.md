*RSS is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format.*


## Docker-Composes
[RSSHub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
[RSSBridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/wiki/Docker#setup)
[FreshRSS](https://hub.docker.com/r/freshrss/freshrss)
[MonitoRSS](https://github.com/synzen/MonitoRSS-Clone/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

**These tools also have Publicly hosted alternatives** 

RSSHub & RSSBridge create RSS Feeds for sites that do not provide such.
FreshRSS Aggregates the Feeds.
MonitoRSS Posts the articles from the RSS feeds to Discord.

Here's how I use these tools.

All my services are password protected and reverse proxied through Cloudflare.

The RSSHub/RSSBridge examples are replaced with our own urls in production.

# Anime
## Anime Art

# Reddit
Majority of Anime Art comes from Twitter and Pixiv. Then gets reposted onto Reddit into various Anime Art subreddits.
<br>
<br>
Reddit provides RSS Feeds natively for Subreddits and Users. Simply append .rss to the end.
<br>
<br>
For Example : `https://old.reddit.com/r/awwnime.rss`

Or we can use RSS-Bridge for more specific cutoffs including upvote count.

### Twitter
Twitter doesn't natively provide RSS feeds. Thus we'll have to use a workaround. 

The workaround is to use RSSHub.

#### Setup

[Sign up for Dev Access](https://developer.twitter.com/)
Add the twitter key & secret to our docker-compose. And continue on.


`TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY:`

`TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET:`

#### Example

Here's an example of a twitter url: `https://twitter.com/search?q=%23anime%20filter%3Amedia%20min_faves%3A1000&src=typed_query&f=top`

Here's that example with RSSHub `https://rsshub.app/twitter/keyword/%23anime%20filter:media%20min_faves:1000`

### Pixiv

Pixiv doesn't have an RSS Feed natively. We'll use RSSHub as a workaround.

#### Setup
[Docs](https://docs.rsshub.app/en/install/#configuration-route-specific-configurations)

Pixiv also uses Cloudflare. Which we'll have to bypass. By adding the following environmental options to our docker-compose.

`PIXIV_BYPASS_CDN: 1`

`PIXIV_BYPASS_HOSTNAME: 1.1.1.1`

We'll also need an account for Pixiv. We can generate a token [following this guide](https://gist.github.com/ZipFile/c9ebedb224406f4f11845ab700124362). We have about a minute window to generate a refresh token.

Afterwards add the token to our docker-compose.
`PIXIV_REFRESHTOKEN:`

#### Example
[Docs](https://docs.rsshub.app/en/social-media.html#pixiv)

Here's an example of a pixiv search `https://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B8%E3%83%8A%E3%83%AB1000users%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A/artworks?s_mode=s_tag`

Here's that example with RSSHub `https://rsshub.app/pixiv/search/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B8%E3%83%8A%E3%83%AB1000users%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A`

We can also RSS the [top rankings](https://www.pixiv.net/ranking.php)

Which would look like: `https://rsshub.app/pixiv/ranking/week`
